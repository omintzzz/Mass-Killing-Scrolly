            <p>
              The Mass Killings database, from the Associated Press, USA Today,
              and Northeastern University features data of killings from
              2006-2025. A mass killing is described as involving four or more
              people killed in an incident.

            <h2>Overall Killings by Race</h2>
            <p>
              For all races, there were more victims than offenders. According
              to Professor James Fox, a key contributor to this database, “The
              overall majority of mass killings were not interracial or race
              motivated and the press, as you know, don't print race so it's
              hard to find.”
            </p>
            <p>
              When discussing how the race of victims and offenders was
              gathered, it was not as simple as looking at these individuals.
              “When I first started on this project, we started collecting race
              based on names and photographs and then the AP said you can't do
              that AP rules say you can't get race based on photographs and
              names can be misleading,” said Fox.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="conclusion-text">
        From examining the dataset, and discussing further with Professor Fox he determined that
      "One contrary to the public perception is that this [mass killings] is not an epidemic and, 
      in fact, not even increasing over the past 20 years" This is because population is about 50% 
      larger than it was in the earlier 80s, when he began researching mass killings.
      "But back in 2006, when the data began, there really hasn’t been much of a change. 
      There has been about an 11% increase in population."


    </p>
    <p class="conclusion-text">
        Fox also believes that from his research, mass killings are rarely indiscriminate; in most cases,
      offenders specifically target people they know for personal reasons.
     Most of the cases in this dataset do not involve race or are hate-based as about 45% of 
    cases are within families and 25% are gang or drug-related. “It is important that when we report the data, 
      we distinguish the kind of cases that worry people”.
